# CS336 Spring 2024 Assignment 1 (Basics) Leaderboard

To submit to the leaderboard, submit a pull request that adds your results to
the Markdown table below. The table should be sorted by increasing loss.

Note that your submission can run for at most 1.5 hours on an H100, and that you
may only use the OpenWebText training dataset that we provide.

In your pull request description, you should include:

- The final validation loss that was recorded
- A link to an associated learning curve that clearly shows a wallclock-time
  x-axis that is less than 1.5 hours . You may either upload an image directly
  to the repo (use the [./images](./images)) folder or link to a
  publicly-viewable plot from a service like Weights and Biases.
- A description of what you did
